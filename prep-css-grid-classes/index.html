        <h3>Raiders of the Lost Ark</h3>
        <p>Lucas conceived Raiders of the Lost Ark in the in the early 1970s.
           Seeking to modernize the serial films of the early 20th-Century.
           he developed the idea further with Kuffman who suggested the Ark
           as the film's goal.  Lucus eventually focused on developing his
           1977 space opera Star Wars.</p>

        <h3>Temple of Doom</h3>
        <p>The Film was released to financial success but initial reviews were
           mixed, criticizing its darker elements and violence.  However, critical
           opinion has improved since 1984, citing the film's intensity and
           imagination.</p>

        <h3>The Last Crusade</h3>
        <p>After the mixed reaction to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,
           Speilberg chose to tone down the dark tone and graphic violence in
           the next installment.  During the five years between The Temple of
           Doom and The Last Cursade, he and executive producer Lucas reviewed
           several scripts before accepting Jeffery Boam's.</p>
